# Train Schedule Website

link: http://ec2-3-12-132-58.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/CS336_g9/

## Description

The website created here simulates a train reservation system, with similar data to the NJ Transit. The site was a semester long project for a MySQL class - thus it emphasizes SQL queries. As a result, frameworks and ORM libraries were not permitted to be used in this. The data is mostly processed using Java Servlets and embedded directly into JSP pages.

This was a group project, and the original repository can be found at the forked repository link: https://github.com/maicodes/CS336_9_Train

## Demos

There is a good chance that the link above does not work, because the course this website was developed for has expired. Thus, the GIF below is only a small preview of the functionality of the site.
